MSD: Mixing Signed Digit Representations for Hardware-efficient DNN Acceleration on FPGA with Heterogeneous Resources

## Introduction
This repository contains the software and hardware open-source for MSD, an FPGA acceleration framework for DNN inference with mixed signed digit representations. 
By fully utilizing the heterogenous recourses on FPGA with different computation methods, this work achieves higher speedup performance compared with the traditional 
DSP-only acceleration. The MSD approach ensures the number representation capability and maintains quantization accuracy of DNN models, with an efficient bit-serial 
computation scheme based on restricted signed digit (RSD).
