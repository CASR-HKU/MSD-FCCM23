# Host codes for running MSD hardware accelerator on FPGAs
The host codes are for compilation and generation of instructions in MSD hardware accelerator. For now, the host code can only be implemented in PYNQ devices (e.g., Pynq-Z2, Ultra96, ZCU102).

The host codes for pynqz2 are different from the ones for Ultra96 and ZCU102.
